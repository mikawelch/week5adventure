We want to utilize the DOM and make the game more interactive

Create a "current_enemy" key in the game object
Populate that key with a random monster from your array (like we did above)
Add a button on the screen called "Attack" (give it an ID as well)
When that button is pressed (eventlistener), call a function named "skirmish"
The skirmish function is going to subtrack our user's damage from the current enemy's hp
AND take the current_enemies attack from our HP
After doing both of those things, check to see if either our or the monsters HP is <= 0
If it is, use alert() to end the game
We also want to display data about the game on the screen so my ma' can play without using the console

Create a paragraph tag for the players name and hp
Create a paragraph for the current_enemies name and hp
Using javascript DOM, update the .innerText of those elements
At the end of the "skirmish" function, update the hp on the screen for both player and monster
 (Links to an external site.)Homework
Add a value to your user object called "has_potion" and set the value to true
Add another button to the screen for 'drink potion'
When that button is clicked, call a function called 'drink potion'
In the function, set the "has_potion" key to false
Also, add 10hp to your user's current HP
If the game.user.has_potion is false, use an alert to let the user know that they don't have a potion to use.
